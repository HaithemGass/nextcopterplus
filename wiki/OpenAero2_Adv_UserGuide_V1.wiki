==The LCD Menu System==

===The Status Screen===
The status screen gives you a continually updated display of the battery status, flight modes and any error messages.
For performance reasons the status screen will switch back to the idle screen after a short interval. The interval defaults to 5 seconds but can be set to up to 30s in the General Menu.

*Status screen*

http://i.imgur.com/He4gOjG.jpg

 * *Mode:* The current mixer preset
 * *Version:* The version number of the loaded firmware
 * *Input:* The RC input mode (CPPM/PWM1, PWM2 or PWM3)
 * *Autolevel:* The current autolevel status (ON/OFF)
 * *Stability:* The current stability status (ON/OFF)
 * *Battery icon:* The battery icon shows the remaining battery capacity. The limits of the capacity meter are calculated from the battery settings menu. For example, if a 3S LiPo is used and the minimum cell voltage is set to 3.7V (370) the graphic will show empty at a total battery voltage of 11.1V. If the maximum cell voltage is set to 4.2V (420) the graphic will show full at a total cell voltage of 12.6V.
 * *Battery voltage:* The battery voltage is displayed under the battery icon

Pressing button 1 goes to the main menu.

*Idle screen*

===Main Menu===
http://i.imgur.com/ZvJ0rRg.jpg

*Main menu*
The main menu stops the loop. The main menu controls should be self-explanatory.
LEFT exits to the status menu
RIGHT goes down into a submenu
UD/DOWN moves through the menu list

*Sub menus*
LEFT exits to the main menu
RIGHT open up an item to edit
UD/DOWN moves through the sub menu list

*Menu item*
LEFT resets the item to its minimum value
RIGHT saves the item
UD/DOWN increments and decrements the item

===General Menu===
http://i.imgur.com/ekizXep.jpg

 * *Mode:* Allows you to select from the input preset mixers. Currently there are presets for dual-aileron aeroplane, flying wing and camera stability.
 * *Orient:* Remaps the sensors so that you can mount the board in one of four different ways.
 * *Contrast:* Allows you to change the contrast of the LCD. See below.
 * *Status time:* Allows you to set the amount of time the status screen is displayed until it is replaced by the idle mode screen. Settable from 1 to 30 seconds.

http://i.imgur.com/cc9ncjb.jpg

 * *LMA timeout:*  Allows you to set the amount of time without RC activity before the Lost Model Alarm goes off. Setting to zero disables the alarm.
 * *Camera stab.:* Setting this to ON allows the board to function without an external RC source. Use only for stand-alone camera stability.
 * *Servo rate:* If Camera Stab is ON, you can increase the servo refresh rate on M1 to M4 to 300Hz. 
 * *Acc LPF:* Allows adjustment of the accelerometer Low-Pass Filter from 1 (infinite) to 64 (about 1 Hz)

http://i.imgur.com/8GNlSJ2.jpg

 * *CF factor:* Controls the fusion of Accelerometer and Gyros. The higher the number the faster as gyro is favoured, the lower the more accurate but slower.
 * *H. Hold:* Heading hold mode. There are three options.
 # *Normal:* Heading hold is processed normally when the I-terms and I-term limits are set correctly.
 # *Auto:* Automatically centers all axis when in heading hold mode if they have drifted off-center.
 # *3D:* Allows the sticks to re-center the I-term neutral when in heading hold mode. Use with great caution and test the mode out first before attempting to fly. Also, make absolutely sure you can switch off stability if required.
 * *Adv.IMU:* There are two options.
 # *OFF:* As per V1.0 and earlier. Sticks over-ride gyro input but gyros dampen sticks.
 # *ON:* Sticks taken into account. Sticks set gyro rotation rate in stability mode and so are much more responsive. Autolevel mode is the same as V1.0 but the IMU takes inverted attitudes into account.

===Adjusting LCD Contrast===

http://i.imgur.com/QvA6c.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/tjW92.jpg
 * Reducing the number reduces contrast.
 * Pressing button 1 "Def." returns the value to the default of 38.
 * Increasing the number increases contrast.

===Receiver Setup Menu===
http://i.imgur.com/thOmcij.jpg

 * *CPPM order:* When using CPPM input, this setting allows you to select either JR/Spektrum (TAER) or Futaba (AETR) channel order. 
 * *RX mode:* Many users have previously experienced trouble with their receivers and OpenAero. For many it was because they did not use a rudder input. The rudder input was used by the software to signify that all channel data had been received. Synching on the rudder was called PWM1. Next I tried the option of synching on the stabilisation channel as it is normally a higher channel number, That is called PWM2. PWM1 and PWM2 are the same as in OpenAero, but PWM3 is new. PWM3 is for synching with whatever is on that fifth channel the KK2 has. If you have no servo jitter, then PWM1 is working for you, but if you use PWM, please try PWM2 and PWM3 to see what difference they make.
 * *Stab input:* Set this to the channel number that you plan to use for stability control.
 * *Autolevel input:* Set this to the channel number that you plan to use for autolev input. It can be the same as for stability if you like.

http://i.imgur.com/GLfbPvq.jpg

 * *2nd aileron:* Set this to the channel number that your radio uses for the second aileron channel.
need a fixed offset to feed that channel. These can be set up here.
 * *Aileron rev:* If your TX cannot reverse channels to suit OpenAero2 then you can do this here. Remember to do this FIRST of all when setting up.
 * *Elevator rev:* If your TX cannot reverse channels to suit OpenAero2 then you can do this here. Remember to do this FIRST of all when setting up. 
 * *Rudder rev:* If your TX cannot reverse channels to suit OpenAero2 then you can do this here. Remember to do this FIRST of all when setting up.

http://i.imgur.com/AUK1PAK.jpg
 * *Differential:* If you wish to use aileron differential, do not set it up in the transmitter, use this setting. Setting 0% is no differential, 50% will limit the upward throw of ailerons to 50% and 100% will result in split ailerons (no upward travel).

===Receiver  inputs Screen===
http://i.imgur.com/twBvVzO.jpg

The RC inputs screen shows you the current values received by the system in either PWM or CPPM mode. In CPPM mode, only the first five channels are shown.

Pressing button 4 "Cal." performs a stick centering calibration. This should make all the numbers on the right-hand column drop to zero. Make sure all controls are centered *including the throttle* before calibration.

Pressing button 3 'Failsafe" saves the current stick positions to the M1 to M8 failsafe setting. The servos will adopt this position in the event of a loss of input signal.
Note that most receivers will still transmit the last known RC values if it loses the TX signal, so this is no test of failsafe. You need to physically disconnect the receiver.
It is recommended that receivers with built-in failsafe be set up and used.
Regardless of your plan to use failsafe, please center all sticks and *set the throttle to minimum* and press button 3. This will set a safe default failsafe.

Pressing button 2 "Trim" will transfer the current TX trim settings into the servo offsets. Bear in mind that as soon as you press this button and exit back to the status menu, your servos will move temporarily out of trim. This is because you now have BOTH TX trims AND OpenAero2 trims set. Simply set the TX trims back to zero and the servos sould be at exactly the same position as you had adjusted previously using the TX trims.
If you screw uo the servo neutral positions by pressing "trim" you will have to reset each of them from the "Servo trims" menu.

===Stability Setup Menu===
http://i.imgur.com/iU30Ehk.jpg
 * *Mode:* This setting determines how the stability is to be controlled. There six options.
 # *OFF:* Always off

 * *THR.pos:* Throttle stick position to enable launch timer.

===Sensor Calibration Screen===
http://i.imgur.com/7dhO81Z.jpg

The sensor inputs screen shows you the current values of all sensors. 
Pressing button 4 "Cal." calibrates the accelerometers. The gyros are calibrated at start-up.

Pressing button 3 "Inv." will initiate an extra inverted calibration step. After doing the normal calibration above, invert the model and press button 3. This helps the software to more accurately detect the inverted attitude.

===Level Meter Screen===
http://i.imgur.com/It14TuJ.jpg

The level meter screen shows you a graphical representation of where the board considers "down" to be. 

===Channel Mixing Menu===
This menu has changed quite a bit from earlier builds.
Now you first select the output number that you wish to modify with the "Setting for:" item.
Once this is set to the right output number you may continue down the settings.

http://i.imgur.com/vMKqZbv.jpg

There is a pair of RC mixers on each output channel. 
You can do delta, taileron, elevon etc mixing with OpenAero2 without needing special transmitter mixing functions.
 * *Src A:* Set the primary channel source to be mixed. 
 * *Vol. (%):* Set the amount of channel A required.
 * *Src B:* Set the secondary channel source to be mixed. 
 * *Vol.(%):* Set the amount of channel B required.

http://i.imgur.com/Km8NsBh.jpg

 * *Source mix:* Copies the RC source through to the mixer. Normally OFF. Advanced users only.
 * *Roll gyro:* Roll gyro signal enable/disable (Off/On). If you wish this output to respond to roll, enable this. 
 * *Direction:* If the response is backwards to what you need, set this to Reversed.

http://i.imgur.com/qoGAYKp.jpg

 * *Pitch gyro:* Pitch gyro signal enable/disable (Off/On). If you wish this output to respond to pitch, enable this. 
 * *Direction:* If the response is backwards to what you need, set this to Reversed.
 * *Yaw gyro:* Yaw gyro signal enable/disable (Off/On). If you wish this output to respond to yaw, enable this. 
 * *Direction:* If the response is backwards to what you need, set this to Reversed.

http://i.imgur.com/uLbQQmh.jpg

 * *Roll acc:* Roll accelerometer signal enable/disable (Off/On). If you wish this output to respond to the roll accelerometer, enable this. 
 * *Direction:* If the response is backwards to what you need, set this to Reversed.
 * *Pitch acc:* Pitch accelerometer signal enable/disable (Off/On). If you wish this output to respond to the pitch accelerometer, enable this. 
 * *Direction:* If the response is backwards to what you need, set this to Reversed.

===Output Mixing Menu===
This menu has changed quite a bit from earlier builds.
Now you first select the output number that you wish to modify with the "Setting for:" item.
Once this is set to the right output number you may continue down the settings.

http://i.imgur.com/ox2b9Lm.jpg

 * *From:* This is the second source for the output mixer. This will be mixed with the primary.
 * *Vol. (%):* The amount of the second channel to be send to the servo/ESC.
 * *From:* This is the third source for the output mixer. This will be mixed with the primary.
 * *Vol. (%):* The amount of the third channel to be send to the servo/ESC.

http://i.imgur.com/IwfS0Li.jpg

 * *From:* This is the fourth source for the output mixer. This will be mixed with the primary.
 * *Vol(%):* The amount of the fourth channel to be send to the servo/ESC.

===Servo Direction Menu===
You can reverse the direction of the servos for each channel here.

http://i.imgur.com/MilvOqE.jpg

===Servo Trim (%) Menu===
You can set the neutral position of each servo from this menu. Note that now the servo updates the new postion in real-time so that you can see the effect immediately.

http://i.imgur.com/GP54Zg3.jpg

===Neg. Servo Trvl(%) Menu===
You can set the maximum negative throw of each servo from this menu. Note that now the servo updates the new postion in real-time so that you can see the effect immediately.

===Pos. Servo Trvl(%) Menu===
You can set the maximum positive throw of each servo from this menu. Note that now the servo updates the new postion in real-time so that you can see the effect immediately.

===Failsafe Menu===
http://i.imgur.com/r5r2OeI.jpg
 * *Mode:* There are two options: *Fixed* which simply transfers the settings from the "Failsafe positions" menu to the servos, and *Adv.* which uses the settings below. In Advanced mode, autolevel is enabled automatically.
 * *THR.pos %:* Throttle position when in advanced failsafe (in %). Note that the throttle position ranges from -100% (min) to 100% (max).
 * *Elevator:* Elevator trim when in advanced failsafe.
 * *Aileron:* Aileron trim when in advanced failsafe.
 * *Rudder:* Rudder trim when in advanced failsafe.

===Failsafe Positions Menu===
You can set here a specific servo position that the servos will move to in Failsafe mode when Failsafe is set to "fixed".
Note that pressing "F/S" on the RC input screen will load the current values into these settings.
Note also that when Failsafe is set to "Advanced", these settinsg will not be used as the settings on the "Failsafe settings" menu will be used instead.

http://i.imgur.com/GP54Zg3.jpg

===Battery Menu===
http://i.imgur.com/3Xlq3a2.jpg
 * *Battery type:* Used internally to preset the min and max cell volatges.
 * *Cells:* Number of cells in your battery pack. When you change this value, OpenAero2 will automatically recalculate the LVA voltage based on the number of cells and the minimum cell voltage.
 * *Alarm (mV):* This is the low battery alarm (LVA) setting. You can change this value at any time, but changing either the number of cells or the minimum cell voltage will over-write the LVA. "1000" equales to 10.00 volts.
 * *Max (mV):* Set this to the maximum cell voltage that you like to use. Defaults to 420 (4.2V) for LiPo.
http://i.imgur.com/GVg5Zjd.jpg
 * *Min (mV):* Set this to the minimum cell voltage that you like to use. defaults to 360 (3.6V) for LiPo. When you change this value, OpenAero2 will automatically recalculate the LVA voltage based on the number of cells and the minimum cell voltage.

==Error messages==
If an error or alarm is detected the buzzer will sound and a message will be displayed on the screen. There are five possible screen messages.

http://i.imgur.com/bnM8R.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/MEX6v.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/zz3pz.jpg

*Sensor Error:* 
When the board is powered up it must remain still so that the gyros can be accurately calibrated. It the boards detects movement during calibration, this error will be displayed. To clear this error, repower the board while keeping the board still.

*Battery Low:*
If you are using the board to monitor the battery voltage, when the current battery voltage falls below the set alarm point, this message is shown. 
If you are not planning to monitor the battery voltage, please set the LVA to zero.

*No Signal:*
This message will be displayed when the board detects a loss of RC signal.

http://i.imgur.com/Oynh2.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/v397I.jpg

*Lost Model:*
Approximately one minute after the last detected RC input, the Lost Model buzzer will sound and this message will be displayed. The alarm can be cancelled with any stick input.

*Throttle High:*
PWM does not require a throttle input in OpenAero2. In CPPM mode however, the throttle signal is passed through the board and appears as a PWM signal on M1.
As a safety measure, if the board is powered up with the throttle set to more than about 5%, the oupts will be disabled, an alarm will sound and this message will be displayed.

==How do I set up OpenAero2?==
===Stability and Autolevel switching===
Due to countless requests you now have absolute freedom in how to enable these modes.
In the Stability and Autolevel Settings menus you can select which method of control you wish to use.

 * OFF: Always off
 * Autochan: On when the channel set as "Autochan" in RC settings is more than the trigger.
 * Stabchan: On when the channel set as "Stabchan" in RC settings is more than the trigger.
 * 3-pos: Stability on when the 3-pos switch is more than the stability trigger. Autolevel also on when the 3-pos switch is more than the autolevel trigger.
 * ON: Always on
 * Handsfree: On when the sticks are released. Please make sure a stick centering procedure has been done before using this more, otherwise the software will be unable to determine the handsfree status.

*3-pos switch*
The three-position switch mode allows you to have both Stability and Autolevel on one switch, but have them selectable.
The way it works is this:
For the switch position between -100% and the stability trigger = Stability off, Autolevel off.
For the switch position between the stability trigger and the autolevel trigger = Stability on, Autolevel off.
For the switch position above the autolevel trigger = Stability on, Autolevel on.

Note that you can change the positions at which these trigger. The "trigger" settings of both the stability and autolevel channels will set these positions.

*RC Setting defaults*
Stabchan = GEAR (AUX input on KK2 board)
Autochan = GEAR (AUX input on KK2 board)
2nd. Aileron = NOCHAN (No second aileron)

==Initial setup and calibration==
The first time you set up OpenAero2 you will have to adjust a few things to suit your radio gear and particular usage. 

*Step 1: Model type*
Go into the General menu and change the Mode to that which suits your model. The default is Aeroplane.

*Step 2: RC settings*
 * Set the Rx mode to suit your radio. Unless you are using CPPM, start with PWM1. CPPM users select CPPM.
 * If you are using CPPM, also select the channel order between either JR/Spektrum or Futaba.
 * Select which input channel you plan to use for stability. PWM users will normally select the fifth channel (GEAR) as that corresponds to the fifth (AUX) input on the KK2. CPPM users can pick any unused channel.
 * Select which input channel you plan to use for autolevel. PWM users may select the unused throttle input (THROTTLE) or double-up the two functions on the fifth channel (GEAR). CPPM users can pick any unused channel.
 * If your radio carries the second aileron channel set that here too.
*Step 3: Stability settings*
 * For now, just alter the Mode as described above in "Stability and Autolevel switching".
*Step 4: Autolevel settings*
 * For now, just alter the Mode as described above in "Stability and Autolevel switching".
*Step 5: RC check*
 * Go to the RC Inputs screen and switch on your transmitter and receiver. You should immediately see values appearing in both columns next to each connected channel.
 * Make sure all the tranmitter channels are centered including the throttle, and press button 4, under the screen label "Cal." This performs a stick centering calibration.
 * The right-hand column should now all be zero and change +/-1000 or so at the extremes of throw.
*EXTREMELY IMPORTANT*

Make sure that when you have both sticks away from you and to the right, all values are POSITIVE. 

If they are negative, then reverse those channels in your TX until they are. 
If your TX cannot reverse channels, go back into the RC Setup menu and use the Aileron/Elevator/Rudder reverse settings.
Do not contine unless all the readings are positive when the sticks are held away from you and to the right. This is the OpenAero2 standard.

*Step 6: Servo direction*

 * Once returned to the status menu, the servos should be activated and you should be able to control all outputs with the transmitter. Please make sure that stability and autolevel are both OFF to continue. Their status can easily be seen in the status menu.

 * Move all surfaces and check that they move as expected. If they are reversed, you must reverse the channels in the M1 to M8 mixers. Do not reverse them with the TX.

 * To reverse the M1 to M8 channels, set the Primary Volume (normally 100%) to -100%.


*Step 7: Gyro direction*
 * Now, switch on stability control while leaving autolevel OFF.
 * Pitch the nose of the model up and down while watching the elevator. The elevator should move to counteract the pitching. Pitching the nose UP should make the elevator move DOWN.
 * If this is not the case, you can reverse the pitch gyro in the M5 mixer menu.
 * Roll the model left and right while watching the ailerons. They should also move to counteract the rolling. Use the M6 and M7 mixer menus to reverse the roll gyro as required.
 * Finally, yaw the model left and right while observing the rudder. Adjust the M8 mixer menu to reverse the yaw gyro as required.

*Step 8: Auto-level setup*
 * Firstly, go into the sensor screen where you can calibrate the autolevel.
 * Place the model on a flat surface and chock up the tail or nose until it is level and in its normal flying attitude.
 * Keeping the model perfectly still, carefully press button 4 under the screen marker "Cal." After a short pause the LED will flash.
 * If you wish the inverted performance to be optimal, at this point you can flip the model over into the inverted position and press button 3 "Inv.". You cannot redo this until you redo the initial calibration with button 4.
 * Go back to the status menu.
 * Switch off stability control and switch ON autolevel.
 * Tilt the model in pitch and roll while watching the respective surfaces. They should move slightly to compensate and remain in that position.
 * If they move in the reverse sense, reverse the pitch and roll acc settings in the mixer menus for M5, M6 and M7 as appropriate.


===Every time you power up OpenAero2===
There are some important things to note when starting OpenAero2.

*Gyro calibration*

The gyros are calibrated automatically when the model is powered up.
It is important that the model is held very still while the gyro calibration is taking place.
If you move the model during calibration the "Sensor Error" message will appear with a warning beep. The only option is to repower the board.


*Safety*

Always make sure your throttle is set to minimum before attempting to power up your model. *Warning:* Even with the transmitter throttle set to zero, there may be a momentary output from the KK board to the throttle channel which may cause the motor to turn very briefly. As such stay well away from the motor and propellor and sure your model when powering it up.

=Donations=
OpenAero2 is a open-source project and is free, however it is also the result of many hundreds of hours of hard work.
If you feel motivated to donate to the project please feel free. I'm always happy to make special versions for people.
