==What is OpenAero2?==
OpenAero2 Beta 8 is a fully-featured aeroplane and camera stabilization software for [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24723 Hobbyking's KK2 multi-rotor board], replacing the manufactures original [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1675613 multi-rotor firmware].

==What models can OpenAero2 stabilize?==
OpenAero2 has been designed with two selectable mixer presets, for easy setup to control both single and dual aileron aeroplane's or flying-wing's.

Unlike other solutions, OpenAero2's on-board mixers are completely flexible, to allow control of up to 8 individual channels or directly connected servos.

===Aeroplane Mixers===
Aeroplane mode has the ability to stabilize all three axis, support the use of flaps or pre-mixed flaperons, with the any typical PWM or CPPM receiver.

The stabilized outputs are simply referred to as aileron, elevator and rudder.

===Flying Wing Mixers===
Mixing for flying-wing's is now supported by the on-board mixers, allowing OpenAero2 to stabilize the left flaperon, right flaperon and rudder.

===Custom Mixers===
OpenAero2 has eight output channels which can all mix from five PWM RC channels in PWM mode, and eight RC channels in CPPM mode. 
Each of the eight output channels can have any or all sensors mixed together. Also, each of the output channels can mix any two RC inputs together.

===Flight Modes===
OpenAero2 offers three unique flight modes for aeroplanes, switchable remotely from the transmitter during flight, upon a designated receiver channel.

1 - *Manual mode* - Deactivates all assistance from OpenAero2, by passing all servo control signals through from the receiver to the servos.

2 - *Stabilization mode* - Activates OpenAero2's gyro stabilization to reduce the affects of wind and air turbulence upon the aeroplane.

3 - *Auto-leveling mode* - Activates OpenAero2's accelerometers to return the aeroplane to level flight.

==What camera gimbals can OpenAero2 stabilize?==
In Camera stability mode both gyros and accelerometers are enabled to stabilise 3-axis camera mounts. See the separate guides for setting up camera stability.

==Where can I purchase a KK2 board from?==
The [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24723 KK2 multi-rotor board] is manufactured and sold only by [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24723 HobbyKing]. Any alternative sources are not recommended.

HobbyKing pay royalties for each unit sold to Rolf R Bakke, the original KK Designer.

===Can I purchase a KK2 board with OpenAero2 installed?===
OpenAero2 has been developed as a free software download only.

The [OpenAero2_Getting_Started Getting Started Guide] describes the process of loading the software onto the KK2 board.
