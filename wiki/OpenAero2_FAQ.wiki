==What is OpenAero2?==
OpenAero2 Beta 8 is a fully-featured aeroplane and camera stabilization software for [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24723 Hobbyking's KK2 multi-rotor board], replacing the manufactures original [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1675613 multi-rotor firmware].

==What models can OpenAero2 stabilize?==
OpenAero2 has been designed with two selectable presets, for easy setup of the on-board mixers, to control single / dual aileron aeroplane's or flying-wing's.

Unlike other solutions, OpenAero2's on-board mixers are completely flexible, to allow control of up to 8 individual channels or directly connected servos.

===Aeroplane Mixers===
Aeroplane mode has the ability to stabilize all three axis, support the use of flaps or pre-mixed flaperons, with the any typical PWM or CPPM receiver.

The stabilized outputs are simply referred to as aileron, elevator and rudder.

===Flying Wing Mixers===
Mixing for flying-wing's is now supported by the on-board mixers, allowing OpenAero2 to stabilize the left flaperon, right flaperon and rudder.

===Custom Mixers===
OpenAero2 has eight output channels which can all mix from five PWM RC channels in PWM mode, and eight RC channels in CPPM mode. 
Each of the eight output channels can have any or all sensors mixed together. Also, each of the output channels can mix any two RC inputs together.

===Flight Modes===
OpenAero2 offers three unique flight modes for aeroplanes, switchable remotely from the transmitter during flight, upon a designated receiver channel.

1 - *Manual mode* - Deactivates all assistance from OpenAero2, by passing all servo control signals through from the receiver to the servos.

2 - *Stabilization mode* - Activates OpenAero2's gyro stabilization to reduce the affects of wind and air turbulence upon the aeroplane.

3 - *Auto-leveling mode* - Activates OpenAero2's accelerometers to return the aeroplane to level flight.

==What camera gimbals can OpenAero2 stabilize?==
In Camera stability mode both gyros and accelerometers are enabled to stabilise 3-axis camera mounts. See the separate guides for setting up camera stability.

==Where can I purchase a KK2 board from?==
The [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24723 KK2 multi-rotor board] is manufactured and sold only by [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=24723 HobbyKing]. Any alternative source is not recommended.

HobbyKing pay royalties for each unit sold to Rolf R Bakke, the original KK Designer.

===Can I purchase a KK2 board with OpenAero2 installed?===
OpenAero2 has been developed as a free software download only.

The process of loading the software, onto the KK2 board, can be done easily by following our guide.

===How do I flash my KK2 board with OpenAero2?===


==How do I connect the KK2 board in my model?==
Once reprogrammed with a [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=21321&aff=97114 USBasp], the KK2 board can be installed between your receiver and servos within your aircraft, to stabilize an aeroplane or a camera gimbal. 

===Dual Power Supplies==
Unlike other boards, the KK2 board benefits from the stability of two regulated power supplies, to prevent receiver brown-outs and a second to power the servos.

A 5 volt regulated power supply must be connected to the pin marked M1. Typically, this can be the 5 volt supply from the ESC's internal BEC.

A second BEC must be connected to any of the pin marked M2-M8, to provide power to move the servos. Depending upon the specification of your servos, 5 to 6 volts can be used.

We recommend the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__4319__TURNIGY_3A_UBEC_w_Noise_Reduction.html Turnigy 3A 5V/6V] & [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16663__HobbyKing_HKU5_5V_5A_UBEC.html HobbyKing HKU5 5A 5V] external UBEC's from Hobbyking.


*Do not connect the 5V supply from M1 or the receiver to the servos on M2-M8, else, the electrical noise from the servos will cause the KK2 board to rebooting during flight and crash your aircraft*

===Receiver connections===
For a standard multi-wire PWM receiver you need to use the normal PWM inputs of the KK board. However, the THR input of the KK board has been repurposed to be the secondary aileron input. *Do not connect the throttle signal from your RX to this input.*

If you have a CPPM receiver, connect the single wire to the RUDDER input. Also, don't forget to enable CPPM mode in the RC Setup menu.

 * AIL: Aileron signal input (required)
 * ELE: Elevator signal input (required)
 * THR: Second aileron signal input (optional)
 * RUD: Rudder signal input (optional) CPPM input
 * AUX: Stability switch input (required)

Please make careful note that for OpenAero2 to output servo signals, at least two inputs, including the stability switch input *MUST* be connected to the KK2 board.

Using the OpenAero2 menus, you can set up how you wish to control stability and autolevel. This will be discussed later in the guide.

Here is a diagram showing how to connect up a PWM receiver.

===CPPM channel order===
CPPM mode requires that the receiver and a transmitter can reallocate channels if not matching the JR/Spektrum or Futaba channel order.
OpenAero2 supports JR/Spektrum and Futaba CPPM channel order as shown below.

*JR/Spektrum*
 * CH1: Throttle
 * CH2: Aileron #1
 * CH3: Elevator
 * CH4: Rudder
 * CH5: Gear switch
 * CH6: Aileron #2
 * CH7: Aux 1
 * CH8: Aux 2 
*Futaba*
 * CH1: Aileron #1
 * CH2: Elevator
 * CH3: Throttle
 * CH4: Rudder
 * CH5: Gear switch
 * CH6: Aileron #2
 * CH7: Aux 1
 * CH8: Aux 2 

===Servo connections===
For conventional aeroplanes the connections are as follows:
 * M1: Throttle (CPPM only)
 * M2: Free channel
 * M3: Free channel
 * M4: Free channel
 * M5: Elevator
 * M6: Left aileron (or primary aileron)
 * M7: Right aileron
 * M8: Rudder

For flying wing models the connections are as follows:
 * M1: Throttle (CPPM only)
 * M2: Free channel
 * M3: Free channel
 * M4: Free channel
