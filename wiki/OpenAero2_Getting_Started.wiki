==How do I mount the KK2 board in my aeroplane?==
For best results, the KK2 board should be securely mounted with [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/RC_PRODUCT_SEARCH.asp?searchType=10&strSearch=M3+Nylon+Threaded+Spacer&location=HK&idCategory=&sortBy=Price1&NumPerPage=20&currentPage= M3 nylon spacers] and [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__17847__M3x8_Nylon_Screws_10pcs_bag_.html nylon screws].

As shown in the following diagram, the two piezo buzzer output pins indicate the front of the KK2 board, while the four buttons indicate the rear of the board.

OpenAero2 now supports five different board orientations. See the [OpenAero2_UserGuide_V2 Basic User Guide] for more info.

==How do I connect the KK2 board in my model?==
The KK2 board should be installed within your aircraft between your receiver and servos, to stabilize an aeroplane or a camera gimbal. 

==How do I power the KK2 board?==
Unlike other boards, the KK2 board benefits from the stability of two regulated power supplies, one to prevent receiver brown-outs and a second to power the servos.

*Do not connect the 5V supply from M1, or the receiver to the servos on M2-M8, else the electrical noise from the servos in flight will cause the KK2 board to reboot and crash your aircraft.*

===KK2 Board===
A 5 volt regulated power supply must be connected to the pin marked M1. Typically, this will be the 5 volt supply from the ESC's internal BEC.
This will provide power to both the KK2 board and the receiver.

===Servos===
A second BEC must be connected to any of the pins marked M2-M8, to power the servos. 
Depending on the specification of your servos, typically a 5 to 6 volt external BEC will be used.

We recommend the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__4319__TURNIGY_3A_UBEC_w_Noise_Reduction.html Turnigy 3A 5V/6V] & [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16663__HobbyKing_HKU5_5V_5A_UBEC.html HobbyKing HKU5 5A 5V] external UBECs from Hobbyking.

==How do I connect my receiver?==
The KK2 board supports either common multi-wire PWM receivers or single-wire CCPM receivers.

Simple wiring can be achieved when the ESC is connected to the pins marked M1 and throttle pass-through is selected. This allows the ESC's internal 5 volt BEC to power the KK2 board and receiver while OpenAero2 can control the ESC's throttle.

===PWM Receivers===
The KK2 board limits common multi-wire PWM receivers to the following inputs.
 * Aileron - Required
 * Elevator - Required
 * Throttle - Optional
 * Rudder - Required
 * Auxiliary - Flight mode switch (required)

Since V1.1 Beta 6, the throttle input channel can be used for the following purposes.
 * *Throttle* - Pass-through to M1 with receivers failsafe,
 * *Throttle* - Pass-through to M1 with OpenAero2's internal failsafe. Orange [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__11965__OrangeRx_R610_Spektrum_DSM2_6Ch_2_4Ghz_Receiver_w_Sat_Port_.html R610] receiver only.
 * *Second Aileron* - For use with pre-mixed flaperons from transmitter.

===CPPM Receivers===
Single-wire receivers can be connected to the *rudder* input for both signal and power.
OpenAero2 supports the JR/Spektrum, Fubata and Spektrum Satellite channel allocations.

||*JR/Spektrum* || *Futaba*|| *Satellite* ||
||CH1: Throttle ||CH1: Aileron #1|| CH1: Flap ||
||CH2: Aileron #1 ||CH2: Elevator|| CH2: Aileron ||

||CH7: Aux 2 ||CH7: Aux 1|| CH7: AUX1 ||
||CH8: Aux 3  ||CH8: Aux 2 || CH8: AUX2 ||


*'CPPM mode' must be selected with the 'RC Setup' menu.*

===Serial receivers===
Serial receivers connect to the KK2 board via the Throttle input. Some of these require a cable adapter to function.

For the Spektrum Satellite, please use the following cable available from HobbyKing.

==How do I connect my servos?==
The OpenAero2 mixer presets support either conventional 'aeroplane mode' or 'flying-wing mode'.

All unassigned channels, designated as 'none' by the mixer presets, can be manually customized for other purposes.

===Aeroplane Mode===
The following channel assignment will apply to most conventional aeroplanes.

  * M1: Throttle - for CPPM users
  * M2: None
  * M3: None
  * M4: None
  * M5: Elevator
  * M6: Left aileron
  * M7: Right aileron
  * M8: Rudder

Where a single aileron servo is required, M6 will become the master and M7 will remain unassigned as 'none'.

===Flying-Wing Mode===
  * M1: Throttle - for CPPM users
  * M2: None
  * M3: None
  * M4: None
  * M5: Elevator
  * M6: Left elevon
  * M7: Right elevon
  * M8: Rudder
