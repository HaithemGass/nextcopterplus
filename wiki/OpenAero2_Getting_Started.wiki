 # Extract the contains of the zip to a 'flash tool' folder on your desktop.
 # Connect the 6 pin head of the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=21321 USBasp] to programming head labeled JP1, in the lower left of the KK2 board, with the ribbon facing towards the screen.
 # Connect the USBasp to a free port on your computer. A green light on the USBasp should now be lit and the screen of KK2 board should now display text. If the screen is lit without any text, follow the [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=23511469&postcount=8334 designers tips], else you can [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/supportform.asp return] the board to your nearest HobbyKing warehouse.
 # Run 'kkMulticopterFlashTool.cmd' from the 'flash tool' folder on your desktop,
 # Select 'USBasp' from the programmer drop-down menu,
 # Select 'Hobbyking KK2.0 (32kB flash)' from the controller drop-down menu,
 # On the 'Flashing firmware' tab, click upon the floppy disc icon,
 # Navigate to the 'OpenAero2' folder upon your desktop,
 # Select the 'OpenAero2.hex' file and click 'open',
 # Maximize the application window, to see the writing and reading progress in the next step,
 # Click the green icon next to the floppy disc to start the writing process.
 # Once complete, ensure the read process has a 100% success rate.
 # Close the 'KKMulticopter Flashtool' and remove the USBasp from the computer.

==How do I mount the KK2 board in my aeroplane?==

For best results, the KK2 board needs to be securely mounted with [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/RC_PRODUCT_SEARCH.asp?searchType=10&strSearch=M3+Nylon+Threaded+Spacer&location=HK&idCategory=&sortBy=Price1&NumPerPage=20&currentPage= M3 nylon spacers] and [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__17847__M3x8_Nylon_Screws_10pcs_bag_.html nylon screws].

==How do I connect the KK2 board in my model?==

can be installed between your receiver and servos within your aircraft, to stabilize an aeroplane or a camera gimbal. 

==How do I power the KK2 board?==

Unlike other boards, the KK2 board benefits from the stability of two regulated power supplies, one to prevent receiver brown-outs and a second to power the servos.

*Do not connect the 5V supply from M1 or the receiver to the servos on M2-M8, else, the electrical noise from the servos will cause the KK2 board to rebooting during flight and crash your aircraft*

===KK2 Board===

A 5 volt regulated power supply must be connected to the pin marked M1. Typically, this will be the 5 volt supply from the ESC's internal BEC.

This will provide power to both the KK2 board and the receiver.

===Servos===

A second BEC must be connected to any of the pin marked M2-M8, to power the servos. 

Depending upon the specification of your servos, typically a 5 to 6 volt external BEC will be used.

We recommend the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__4319__TURNIGY_3A_UBEC_w_Noise_Reduction.html Turnigy 3A 5V/6V] & [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16663__HobbyKing_HKU5_5V_5A_UBEC.html HobbyKing HKU5 5A 5V] external UBEC's from Hobbyking.

==How do I connect my receiver==

The KK2 board supports either common multi-wire PWM receivers or single-wire CCPM receivers.

===PWM Receivers===



For a standard multi-wire PWM receiver you need to use the normal PWM inputs of the KK board. However, the THR input of the KK board has been repurposed to be the secondary aileron input. *Do not connect the throttle signal from your RX to this input.*


 * AIL: Aileron signal input (required)
 * ELE: Elevator signal input (required)
 * THR: Second aileron signal input (optional)
 * RUD: Rudder signal input (optional) CPPM input
 * AUX: Stability switch input (required)

Please make careful note that for OpenAero2 to output servo signals, at least two inputs, including the stability switch input *MUST* be connected to the KK2 board.

Using the OpenAero2 menus, you can set up how you wish to control stability and autolevel. This will be discussed later in the guide.

Here is a diagram showing how to connect up a PWM receiver.

===CPPM Receivers===

If you have a CPPM receiver, connect the single wire to the RUDDER input. Also, don't forget to enable CPPM mode in the RC Setup menu.


CPPM mode requires that the receiver and a transmitter can reallocate channels if not matching the JR/Spektrum or Futaba channel order.
OpenAero2 supports JR/Spektrum and Futaba CPPM channel order as shown below.

*JR/Spektrum*
 * CH1: Throttle
 * CH2: Aileron #1
 * CH3: Elevator
 * CH4: Rudder
 * CH5: Gear switch
 * CH6: Aileron #2
 * CH7: Aux 1
 * CH8: Aux 2 
*Futaba*
 * CH1: Aileron #1
 * CH2: Elevator
 * CH3: Throttle
 * CH4: Rudder
 * CH5: Gear switch
 * CH6: Aileron #2
 * CH7: Aux 1
 * CH8: Aux 2 

==How do I connect my servos?==

For conventional aeroplanes the connections are as follows:
 * M1: Throttle (CPPM only)
 * M2: Free channel
 * M3: Free channel
 * M4: Free channel
 * M5: Elevator
 * M6: Left aileron (or primary aileron)
 * M7: Right aileron
 * M8: Rudder

For flying wing models the connections are as follows:
 * M1: Throttle (CPPM only)
 * M2: Free channel
 * M3: Free channel
 * M4: Free channel
 * M5: Elevator
 * M6: Left elevon
 * M7: Right elevon
 * M8: Rudder
