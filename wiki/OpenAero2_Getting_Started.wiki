 # Extract the contains of the zip file to a 'flash tool' folder on your desktop.
 # Connect the 6 pin head of the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=21321 USBasp] to the ISP programming head labeled JP1, in the lower left of the KK2 board, with the ribbon facing towards the screen.
 # Connect the USBasp to a free port on your computer. A green light on the USBasp should now be lit and the screen of KK2 board should now display text. If the screen is lit without any text, follow the [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=23511469&postcount=8334 designers tips], else you can [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/supportform.asp return] the board to your nearest HobbyKing warehouse.
 # Run 'kkMulticopterFlashTool.cmd' from the 'flash tool' folder on your desktop,
 # Select 'USBasp' from the programmer drop-down menu,
 # Select 'Hobbyking KK2.0 (32kB flash)' from the controller drop-down menu,
 # On the 'Flashing firmware' tab, click on the floppy disc icon,
 # Navigate to the 'OpenAero2' folder on your desktop,
 # Select the 'OpenAero2.hex' file and click 'open',
 # Maximize the application window to see the writing and reading progress in the next step,
 # Click the green icon next to the floppy disc to start the writing process.
 # Once complete, ensure the read process has a 100% success rate.
 # Close the 'KKMulticopter Flashtool' and remove the USBasp from the computer.

==How do I mount the KK2 board in my aeroplane?==

For best results, the KK2 board should be securely mounted with [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/RC_PRODUCT_SEARCH.asp?searchType=10&strSearch=M3+Nylon+Threaded+Spacer&location=HK&idCategory=&sortBy=Price1&NumPerPage=20&currentPage= M3 nylon spacers] and [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__17847__M3x8_Nylon_Screws_10pcs_bag_.html nylon screws].

As shown in the following diagram, the two piezo buzzer output pins indicate the front of the KK2 board, while the four buttons indicate the rear of the board.

==How do I connect the KK2 board in my model?==

The KK2 board should be installed within your aircraft, between your receiver and servos, to stabilize an aeroplane or a camera gimbal. 

==How do I power the KK2 board?==

Unlike other boards, the KK2 board benefits from the stability of two regulated power supplies, one to prevent receiver brown-outs and a second to power the servos.

*Do not connect the 5V supply from M1, or the receiver to the servos on M2-M8, else the electrical noise from the servos in flight will cause the KK2 board to reboot and crash your aircraft*

===KK2 Board===

A 5 volt regulated power supply must be connected to the pin marked M1. Typically, this will be the 5 volt supply from the ESC's internal BEC.

This will provide power to both the KK2 board and the receiver.

===Servos===

A second BEC must be connected to any of the pins marked M2-M8, to power the servos. 

Depending on the specification of your servos, typically a 5 to 6 volt external BEC will be used.

We recommend the [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__4319__TURNIGY_3A_UBEC_w_Noise_Reduction.html Turnigy 3A 5V/6V] & [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__16663__HobbyKing_HKU5_5V_5A_UBEC.html HobbyKing HKU5 5A 5V] external UBEC's from Hobbyking.

==How do I connect my receiver==

The KK2 board supports either common multi-wire PWM receivers or single-wire CCPM receivers.

===PWM Receivers===

Common multi-wire PWM receivers are limited to the following inputs.

 * Aileron - Required
 * Elevator - Required
 * Throttle - Optional
 * Rudder - Required
 * Auxiliary - Flight mode switch (required)

Since V1.1 Beta 6, the throttle input channel can be used for the following purposes.

 * *Throttle* - Pass-through to M1 with receivers failsafe,

 * *Throttle* - Pass-through to M1 with OpenAero2's internal failsafe. Orange [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__11965__OrangeRx_R610_Spektrum_DSM2_6Ch_2_4Ghz_Receiver_w_Sat_Port_.html R610] receiver only.
 * *Second Aileron* - For use for pre-mixed flaperons from transmitter.

Simple wiring can be achieved when the ESC is connected to the pins marked M1 and throttle pass-through is selected. This allows the ESC's internal 5 volt BEC to power the KK2 board and receiver while OpenAero2 can control the ESC's throttle.

===CPPM Receivers===

Single-wire receivers can be connected to the *rudder* input for both signal and power.

OpenAero2 supports either the JR/Spektrum or Fubata channel allocation.

*JR/Spektrum*
 * CH1: Throttle
 * CH2: Aileron #1
 * CH3: Elevator
 * CH4: Rudder
 * CH5: Gear switch
 * CH6: Aileron #2
 * CH7: Aux 1
 * CH8: Aux 2 
*Futaba*
 * CH1: Aileron #1
 * CH2: Elevator
 * CH3: Throttle
 * CH4: Rudder
 * CH5: Gear switch
 * CH6: Aileron #2
 * CH7: Aux 1
 * CH8: Aux 2 

*'CPPM mode' must be selected with the 'RC Setup' menu.*

==How do I connect my servos?==

The OpenAero2 mixer presets support either conventional 'aeroplane mode' or 'flying-wing mode'.

All unassigned channels designated as 'none' by the mixer presets can be manually customized for other purposes.

===Aeroplane Mode===

The following channel assignment will apply to most conventional aeroplanes.

  * M1: Throttle - PWM pass-through or CPPM
  * M2: None
  * M3: None
  * M4: None
  * M5: Elevator
  * M6: Left aileron
  * M7: Right aileron
  * M8: Rudder

Where a single aileron servo is required, M6 will become the master and M7 will remain unassigned as 'none'.

===Flying-Wing Mode===

  * M1: Throttle - PWM pass-through or CPPM
  * M2: None
  * M3: None
  * M4: None
  * M5: Elevator
  * M6: Left elevon
  * M7: Right elevon
  * M8: Rudder
