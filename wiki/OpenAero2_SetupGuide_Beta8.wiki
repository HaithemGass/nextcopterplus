=Aeroplane - Setup guide (V1.1 Beta 8)=

==1. Factory reset==

This guide presumes all values have been reset to their factory default values, for a quick and easy setup, from 'factory reset' to 'ready to fly'.

 # Hold down all four buttons while powering up the KK2 board,
 # A "*Reset*" message will briefly appear on the screen after the OpenAero2 logo is displayed,
 # Release all buttons once the red LED has blinked,
 # OpenAero will continue to display the status screen.

==2. Model Type==

OpenAero2 has been designed with two selectable model types, for easy setup to control both single and dual aileron aeroplane's or flying-wing's.

To display these model types, enter the *'General'* sub-menu and select '*Mode:*'.

Unlike other solutions, OpenAero2's on-board mixers are completely flexible to allow control of up to 8 individual channels or directly connected servos. 

Please refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_UserGuide_Beta8 'Aeroplane - Advanced User Guide (V1.1 Beta 8)'] for more information on how to customize the mixers.

==3. Board Orientation==

OpenAero2 currently supports the following 3 mounting orientations.

 # Horizontal - Default orientation, buttons facing aft with screen to the front.
 # Vertical - Buttons down with screen on top.
 # Upside down - Inverted, buttons facing aft with screen to the front.

To change the default orientation from horizontal, modify the 'orient' option within the 'general' menu.

==4. Receiver setup==

The KK2 board supports either common multi-wire PWM receivers or single-wire CCPM receivers.

To setup OpenAero2 with your receiver, navigate through the following options, within the '*RC Setup*' sub-menu.

 # CPPM order - *JR/Spk* or *Futaba* - Defines OpenAero2's channel order for CPPM receivers,
 # RX mode - *PW1* or *CCPM* - Typically '*PWM1*' for PWM receivers and '*CCPM*' for CPPM receivers,
 # Stability input - *Gear* - Default for both PWM and most CPPM receivers,
 # Autolevel input - Defines a second channel for manual activation of autoleveling.
  * *Gear* - Typical for PWM receivers and optional for CPPM receivers,
  * *Throttle* - PWM receivers *only*. Allows re-purposing of KK2 throttle channel as second channel to control autoleveling.
 # 2nd Aileron - Defines how M6 operates a second aileron servo.
  * *None* - M6 will remain unassigned and will *not* operate a second aileron servo.
  * *Aileron* - Primary aileron channel used to operate second aileron. Commonly used to simplify setup.
  * *Aileron2* - CPPM receivers *only*. Allows use of additional channel to utilize flaperon mixing within transmitter.
  * *Throttle* - PWM receivers *only*. Allows re-purposing of throttle channel to utilize flaperon mixing within transmitter.

==5. Stick Calibration==

Center stick calibration allows OpenAero2 to determine pilot commands to roll an axis and possible automatic activation of advanced features.

The 'RC input' screen shows the current PWM or CPPM receiver values for the first five channels. 

Within the '*RC Inputs*' sub-menu, select 'Calibrate' (button 4), to return all the values to zero.

When using a CPPM or PWM receiver with throttle pass-through, ensure the throttle stick is also at center stick.

Note - if using 3-position flight switch, ensure the physical switch  is centered when calibrating the input channels.

==6. Stick Polarity==

With both sticks in their top right corners, ensure all the values are positive.

If not, reverse the problematic channel in RC Setup.

Bug with aileron input reversal.

# Aileron reverse - Normal/Reverse
 # Elevator reverse - Normal/Reverse
 # Rudder reverse - Normal/Reverse

==7. Stability Setup==

Stability, Mode - 3 position switch

==8. Auto-level Setup==
