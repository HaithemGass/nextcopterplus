=Aeroplane - Setup guide (V1.1 Beta 9)(Coming)=

===Factory reset===
This guide presumes all values have been reset to their factory default values, for a quick and easy setup, from 'factory reset' to 'ready to fly'.

 # Hold down all four buttons while powering up the KK2 board,
 # A "*Reset*" message will briefly appear on the screen after the OpenAero2 logo is displayed,
 # Release all buttons once the red LED has blinked,
 # OpenAero will continue to display the status screen.

==1. General==
===Model Type===
OpenAero2 has been designed with two selectable model types, for easy setup to control both single and dual aileron aeroplane's or flying-wing's.

To display these model types, enter the *'1.General'* sub-menu and select '*Mode:*'.

Unlike other solutions, OpenAero2's on-board mixers are completely flexible to allow control of up to 8 individual channels or directly connected servos. 

Please refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_UserGuide_V1 'Aeroplane - Advanced User Guide (V1.1 Beta 9)'] for more information on how to customize the mixers

===Board Orientation===
OpenAero2 supports the following four mounting orientations.

 * Forward - Default horizontal orientation, buttons facing *aft* with screen to the *front*.
 * Aft - Horizontal, buttons facing *front* with screen to the *aft*.
 * Inverted - *Inverted* horizontal, buttons facing *aft* with screen to the *front*.
 * Vertical - *Upright*, buttons *down* with the screen on *top*.

To change the default orientation from horizontal, modify the '*orient*' option within the '*1.General*' menu.

===Flight Control===



==2. Receiver setup==
The KK2 board supports either common multi-wire PWM receivers or single-wire CCPM receivers.

To setup OpenAero2 with your receiver, navigate through the following options, within the '*RC Setup*' sub-menu.

 # CPPM order - *JR/Spk* or *Futaba* - Defines OpenAero2's channel order for CPPM receivers,
 # RX mode - *Rudder* or *CCPM* - Typically '*PWM1*' for PWM receivers and '*CCPM*' for CPPM receivers,
 # Stability input - *Gear* - Default for both PWM and most CPPM receivers,
 # Autolevel input - Defines a second channel for manual activation of autoleveling.
  * *Gear* - Typical for PWM receivers and optional for CPPM receivers,
  * *Throttle* - PWM receivers *only*. Allows re-purposing of KK2 throttle channel as second channel to control autoleveling.
 # 2nd Aileron - Defines how M6 operates a second aileron servo.
  * *None* - M6 will remain unassigned and will *not* operate a second aileron servo.
  * *Aileron* - Primary aileron channel used to operate second aileron. Commonly used to simplify setup.
  * *Aileron2* - CPPM receivers *only*. Allows use of additional channel to utilize flaperon mixing within transmitter.
  * *Throttle* - PWM receivers *only*. Allows re-purposing of throttle channel to utilize flaperon mixing within transmitter.

==3. Receiver Inputs==
===Stick Calibration===
Center stick calibration allows OpenAero2 to determine pilot commands, roll an axis and activate auto leveling.

The 'RC input' screen shows the current PWM or CPPM receiver values for the first five channels. 

Within the '*RC Inputs*' sub-menu, select 'Calibrate' (button 4), to return all the values to zero.

When using a CPPM or PWM receiver with throttle pass-through, ensure the throttle stick is also at center stick.

Additionally, if using a 3-position flight switch, ensure the switch  also centered.

===Stick Polarity===
OpenAero2 has been designed to unify the polarity of all receivers and prevent setup errors.

While viewing the '*RC Input*' display, complete the following checks and reverse the transmitter channel if a *negative* value is displayed.

 * Move the rudder stick right, 
 * Move the aileron stick right,

 * Push the elevator stick forwards / away.
 * Move the throttle stick to full throttle.

Once the above has been completed, all positive values should be displayed within '*RC Input*', when both sticks are pushed forwards / away and to the right.

*Ensure the motor has been disconnect prior to completing the above setup.*

==7. Stability Setup==

OpenAero2 supports the remote activation of gyro stabilization either via a two or three position switch.

By default, the '*StabChan*' option allows a 2-position switch to activate gyro stabilization via the '*gear*' channel, defined by '*stab input*' within '*RC Setup*' menu. A 2-position flight switch will be limited to gyro stabilization *on* or *off*.

Optionally, selecting '*3-pos*' allows a 3-position switch to alternate between all three flight modes upon the single '*gear*' channel. 

Make sure your 3-position switch is set to -100%, 0%, +100% and the switch was centered when 'stick calibration' was ran.

==8. Auto-level Setup==

Similar to stability mode, OpenAero2 supports the remote activation of autoleveling either via a two or three position switch.

By default, the '*AutoChan*' option allows a 2-position switch to activate autoleveling via the '*gear*' channel, defined by '*Autolev input*' within '*RC Setup*' menu. A 2-position flight switch will be limited to autoleveling *on* or *off*.

However, if the '*gear*' channel is used for both '*StabChan*' and '*AutoChan*', both stabilization and autoleveling will be switch on and off together.

Please refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_UserGuide_Beta8 'Aeroplane - Advanced User Guide (V1.1 Beta 8)'] for more information on 'Hands Free' mode.
