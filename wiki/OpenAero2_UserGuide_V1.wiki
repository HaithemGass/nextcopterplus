=Aeroplane - Quick Setup guide (V1.1 Beta 9)(Coming Soon)=

===Factory reset===
This guide presumes all values have been reset to their factory default values, for a quick and easy setup, from a 'factory reset' to 'ready to fly'.

 # Hold down all four buttons while powering up the KK2 board,
 # A "*Reset*" message will briefly appear on the screen after the OpenAero2 logo is displayed,
 # Release all buttons once the red LED has blinked,
 # OpenAero will continue to display the status screen.

==1. General==
===Model Type===
OpenAero2 has been designed with selectable model presets, for easy setup to control both single and dual aileron aeroplane's or flying-wing's.

 * Aero - Default preset for both *single* and *dual aileron* aeroplane's.
 * F.Wing - Selectable preset for *flying-wing*'s.
 * CamStab - For standalone [https://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_CamStab_Setup_Part_1 camera stabilization] & with  [https://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_CamStab_Setup_Part_2  RC control] only.

Unlike other solutions, OpenAero2's on-board mixers are completely flexible to allow control of up to 8 individual channels or directly connected servos. 

Please refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_UserGuide_V1 'Aeroplane - Advanced User Guide (V1.1 Beta 9)'] for more information on how to customize the mixers

===Board Orientation===
OpenAero2 supports the following four mounting orientations.

 * Forward - Default horizontal orientation, buttons facing *aft* with screen to the *front*.
 * Aft - Horizontal, buttons facing *front* with screen to the *aft*.
 * Inverted - *Inverted* horizontal, buttons facing *aft* with screen to the *front*.
 * Vertical - *Upright*, buttons *down* with the screen on *top*.

==2. Receiver setup==
===Receiver Sync===
While the KK2 board is limited to 5 PWM channels from a multi-wire receivers, OpenAero2 can support 8 CPPM channels from a single-wire receiver.

 * Rudder - Default for most multi-wire PWM receivers.
 * CPPM - Listens for a compatible multi-channel stream on the *rudder* input only.
 
===CPPM order===
With a compatible CPPM receiver attached to the rudder input only, OpenAero2 supports either *JR/Spk* or *Futaba* channel order. 

The order of the channels will be define by the brand of your transmitter.

===Stability input===
OpenAero2 allows any input channel to remotely enable or disable gyro stability.

By default, both PWM & CPPM setups commonly use the '*gear*' channel.

===Autolevel input===
Similar to stability mode, OpenAero2 allows any input channel to remotely enable or disable auto-leveling.

 * *Gear* - Typically used by PWM receivers on the same 2 or 3 position flight switch.
 * *AUX1* - Commonly used by CPPM receivers on a second individual flight switch.

===2nd Aileron===
In addition to an aileron on output 6, OpenAero2 can control a second aileron on output 7. Three methods are supported.

 * *None* - M7 remains unassigned and will *not* operate a second aileron 
 * *Aileron* - Commonly used with PWM receivers to control a second aileron on output 7.

====Flaperon====
Allows both ailerons to be used as flaperons, where the flaps and ailerons are pre-mixed within the transmitter, prior to OpenAero2.

 * *Throttle* - PWM receivers only.
 * *AUX1* - CPPM receivers only.

==3. Receiver Inputs==
The 'Receiver Inputs' screen shows the current receiver values of the first five channels with either a PWM or CPPM receiver.

===Stick Calibration===
Center stick calibration allows OpenAero2 to center both PWM & CPPM receivers input, to ensure correct roll rate and selection of flight modes.

When selecting 'cal', ensure both throttle stick and any 3-position flight switch are centered.

===Stick Polarity===
OpenAero2 has been designed to unify the polarity of all receivers and prevent setup errors.

While viewing the '*Receiver Inputs*' display, complete the following checks and reverse the transmitter channel if a *negative* value is displayed.

 # Move the rudder stick right, check the rudder polarity.
 # Move the aileron stick right, check the aileron polarity.
 # Move the aileron stick right, check the polarity of the second aileron, define by '2nd aileron'.
 # Push the elevator stick forwards / away, check the elevator polarity.
 # Move the throttle stick to full throttle,  check the throttle polarity.

Once the above has been completed, all positive values should be displayed within '*RC Input*', when both sticks are pushed forwards / away and to the right.

*Ensure the motor has been disconnect prior to completing the above setup.*

==7. Stability Setup==

OpenAero2 supports the remote activation of gyro stabilization either via a two or three position switch.

By default, the '*StabChan*' option allows a 2-position switch to activate gyro stabilization via the '*gear*' channel, defined by '*stab input*' within '*RC Setup*' menu. A 2-position flight switch will be limited to gyro stabilization *on* or *off*.

Optionally, selecting '*3-pos*' allows a 3-position switch to alternate between all three flight modes upon the single '*gear*' channel. 

Make sure your 3-position switch is set to -100%, 0%, +100% and the switch was centered when 'stick calibration' was ran.

==8. Auto-level Setup==

Similar to stability mode, OpenAero2 supports the remote activation of autoleveling either via a two or three position switch.

By default, the '*AutoChan*' option allows a 2-position switch to activate autoleveling via the '*gear*' channel, defined by '*Autolev input*' within '*RC Setup*' menu. A 2-position flight switch will be limited to autoleveling *on* or *off*.

However, if the '*gear*' channel is used for both '*StabChan*' and '*AutoChan*', both stabilization and autoleveling will be switch on and off together.

Please refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/nextcopterplus/wiki/OpenAero2_UserGuide_Beta8 'Aeroplane - Advanced User Guide (V1.1 Beta 8)'] for more information on 'Hands Free' mode.

Optionally, selecting '*3-pos*' allows a 3-position switch to alternate between all three flight modes upon the single '*gear*' channel. 

Make sure your 3-position switch is set to -100%, 0%, +100% and the switch was centered when 'stick calibration' was ran.
